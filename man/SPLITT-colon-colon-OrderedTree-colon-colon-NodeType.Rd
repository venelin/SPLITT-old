\title{Abstract type for nodes in the tree.}
\description{
A public typedef in class \code{\link[=SPLITT::OrderedTree]{OrderedTree}}. A synonym for the 
  template argument \code{Node}. Defines a 
  hash-able type such as \code{int} or 
  \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string}{\code{std::string}}. 
  Specifically, this should be a type for which 
  \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/hash}{\code{std::hash}}
  specialization does exist. This is the application-specific node-type. 
  The branches in the tree are defined as couples of nodes 
  <branch_start_node, branch_end_node>.
}
\details{
During the construction of 
\code{\link[=SPLITT::OrderedTree]{OrderedTree}} object, the nodes are 
assigned \code{unsigned int} ids from 0 to M-1 (M being the number of nodes 
in the tree).
