# The **SPLITT** class diagram

The figure below represents a UML class diagram of the **SPLITT** library:


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "792px", out.height = "612px"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Uml1.png")
```

The library is divided in two layaers:

- a framework layer defining the main logical and data structures. These include a linear algorithm for initial reordering and splitting of the input tree into generations of nodes, which can be visited in parallel, both during post-order as well as pre-order traversal, and a growing collection of pre-order and post-order traversal algorithms, targeting different parallelization modes (e.g. queue-based versus range-based parallelization) on different computing devices (currently implemented for CPUs only).
- a user layer at which the user of the library must write a `TraversalSpecification`-class defining all typedefs and methods of the interface `TraversalSpecification`. 

The bridge between the two layers is provided by an object of the `TraversalTask` template class. Once the `TraversalSpecification` implementation has been written, the user instantiates a `TraversalTask` object passing the tree and the input data as arguments.
