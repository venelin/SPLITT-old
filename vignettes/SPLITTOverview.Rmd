# The **SPLITT** class diagram

The figure below represents a UML class diagram of the **SPLITT** library:


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "792px", out.height = "612px"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Uml1.png")
```

The library is divided in two layaers:

- a framework layer defining the main logical and data structures. These include a linear algorithm for initial reordering and splitting of the input tree into generations of nodes, which can be visited in parallel, both during post-order as well as pre-order traversal, and a growing collection of pre-order and post-order traversal algorithms, targeting different parallelization modes (e.g. queue-based versus range-based parallelization) on different computing devices (currently implemented for CPUs only).
- a user layer at which the user of the library must write a `TraversalSpecification` class defining all typedefs and methods of the interface `TraversalSpecification`. 

The bridge between the two layers is provided by an object of the `TraversalTask` template class. Once the `TraversalSpecification` implementation has been written, the user instantiates a `TraversalTask` object passing the tree and the input data as arguments.

# Packages used
```{r create-references, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
treeProcessing <- c("ape")
data <- c("data.table")
testing <- c("testthat")

packagesUsed <- c(treeProcessing, data, testing)

printPackages <- function(packs) {
  res <- ""
  for(i in 1:length(packs)) {
    res <- paste0(res, paste0(packs[i], ' v', packageVersion(packs[i]), ' [@R-', packs[i], ']'))
    if(i < length(packs)) {
      res <- paste0(res, ', ')
    }
  }
  res
}

# Write bib information (this line is executed manually and the bib-file is edited manually after that)
#knitr::write_bib(packagesUsed, file = "./REFERENCES-R.bib")
```

Apart from base R functionality, the patherit package uses a number of 3rd party R-packages:

* For tree processing: `r printPackages(treeProcessing)`;
* For reporting: `r printPackages(data)`;
* For testing: `r printPackages(testing)`.
