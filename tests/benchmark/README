The benchmarks were executed with PCMBase_1.1.0.tar.gz and PCMBaseCpp_0.0.2.tar.gz.
The source-packages are found in this directory.

To run a job on the cluster with <n> cpus execute the following commands:

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<n>
export OMP_PROC_BIND=FALSE
bsub -n <n> R --vanilla --slave -f runCluster.R --args <n>

Wait for the job to start before changing the variables OMP_NUM_THREADS and OMP_PROC_BIND.
