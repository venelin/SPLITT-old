Description: SPLITT is a one-header-only generic C++ library for serial and
 parallel pre-order and post-order traversal of trees. The library implements
 several algorithms for parallel lineage traversal and is capable to choose 
 automatically the fastest implementation for a particular visit-node operation
 and data. To use the library, the user writes an implementation of the implicit
 interface class TraversalSpecification defining the types of the input data, 
 node state, and traversal type and the operation to be performed on each node 
 during the traversal. As an example, the package provides a parallel 
 implementation of the 3-point structure algorithm for calculating the 
 determinant and quadratic forms of 3-point structured matrices, which are often
 encountered in Gaussian phylogenetic comparative models (Ho and Ane, 2014). The
 example includes an Rcpp module exposing the algorithm to the R environment.
