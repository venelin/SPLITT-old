Description: SPLITT is a one-header-only generic C++ library for serial and
 parallel pre-order and post-order traversal of trees. The library implements
 several algorithms for parallel lineage traversal and is capable to choose 
 automatically the fastest implementation for a particular visit-node operation
 and data. To use the library, the user writes an implementation of the implicit
 interface class TraversalSpecification defining the types of the input data, 
 node state, and traversal type and the operation to be performed on each node 
 during the traversal.
