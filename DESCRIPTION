Description: SPLITT is a one-header-only generic C++ library for serial and
 parallel pre-order and post-order traversal of trees. The library implements
 several algorithms for parallel lineage traversal and is capable to choose 
 automatically the fastest implementation for a particular visit-node operation
 and data. To use the library, the user writes TraversalSpecification-class 
 defining the types of the input data, node state, and traversal type and the
 operation to be performed on each node during the traversal. This package provides
 a function called 'CreateRPackageFromTemplate' allowing to quickly create a new 
 R-package calling SPLITT via an Rcpp module.
